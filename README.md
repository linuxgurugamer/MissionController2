##MissionController2
==================

MissionController 2 is the successor to the original Mission Controller.  Once Kerbal Space Program released its own contracts I decided to drop development of the original mission controller and develop a system based off the KSP contract system.  The following code is a complete Rewrite and original work of Malkuth.  The only thing Mission Controller and MissionController 2 share is the name.


##New Contract Types:

*NEW 1.07 Civilian tours, bring civilian Kerbals on low Orbit tour of Kerbin.
*Deliver Satellite for A company (build your own)
*Repair Missions using the repair partts and dedicated repair panel.
*Lander Research Mission
*Orbital Research Mission
*Custom ComSat contract that you can change the values to help suit your Remote Tech Needs.
*Custom supply contract that you can use to supply your stations with fuel, food, oxygen, etc. your choice, your contracts!
*NEW 1.06 Custom Crew Supply Contract. Supply those stations and bases with crew. Allows choice of station and amount of crew and the time on station for contract.
*8 Historical contracts based on the United States and Soviet space race. (More to come)
*New 1.06 New SkyLab 4 new contracts covering the launch and operation of Americas first Space Station SkyLab.

##Hire kerbals and Death Insurance. 
Kerbals cost money now.  And if they die on duty you must pay a Insurance fee for that death.

##Mission Controller Non Cheat Revert Button

During flight if you look up at the Default tool bar you will see a big red button. This button is the Mission Controller
Revert button. Unlike the cheaty pumpkin eatin KSP revert button, press this and you will get a revert option back
to VAB. But you will be charged 1000 Funds for the Time the button had to waste sending you back to VAB. Use this as 
your TEST button. And don't feel ashamed!

## Customize your experience.
Pretty much everything in MissionController 2 has a setting you can adjust.  You can turn on and off any contract type in the
Mod.  And also can turn off and on some of Kerbal Space Programs Contracts you might not like.

##Installation

When installing new version I highly suggest you do these steps to reset your contracts. 
1. Alt-F12
2. Select Contracts tab.
3. Select Tools.
4. Select Clear Current contracts.
5. This will wipe any old contracts and refresh the whole list.

To Install Mission Controller

To install new version I highly suggest you delete your old MissionControllerEC folder! And install the new version 
fresh! This helps to make sure everyone is on an even playing field with issues. You can now set up 
your Settings in game, so this should not be a big deal. Its highly recomended! Please. 

place the MissionControllerEC folder into you KerbalSpaceProgram/GameData folder. 

Note on 64 Bit. I test MCE in 64 bit and play it fine. But when I add more mods to my games, things go bad for 64 bit KSP. 
I highly suggest you play a massive modded KSP in 32 bit only! If it doesn't work in
64 Bit Go To 32Bit. Thank you.
